## ⚠️ Note about API Quota
This project was fully functional and tested successfully with the **Gemini API**.  
However, the free quota for the API has been exceeded, so the live demo is not currently working.  

# ✨ Features

✅Start a new chat or click on customized prompt buttons. 
✅Each new conversation is saved as a recent chat, allowing you to revisit and continue your dialogue with the AI at any time. 
✅The application remembers previous conversations and generates responses based on that history. 
✅Each conversation is kept separate, ensuring that the history of one chat does not interfere with others.

Technologies I used: 
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and ReactJS.
